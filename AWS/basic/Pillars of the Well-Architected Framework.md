# Operational excellence pillar

In the Government Lens, the operational excellence pillar describes the ability to support the departmental mandate and government priorities to run services effectively, gain insight into operations, and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures to deliver policy outcomes and public value.

The following questions and best practices complement the best practices in the [Operational Excellence Pillar whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/operational-excellence-pillar/welcome.html).

# Security pillar

The security pillar encompasses the ability to protect data, services, and systems by taking advantage of cloud technologies to improve your security, including practices for understanding the threat and risks, empowering end users to control how their data is used, and shifting to real time monitoring and escalation models for security.

The following questions and best practices are designed to complement the best practices in the [Security Pillar whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/welcome.html).

# Reliability pillar

The reliability pillar encompasses the ability of a service to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when itâ€™s expected to. This includes the ability to operate and test the service through its total lifecycle and includes a high level of planning around service continuity and perceived reliability by the public.

The following questions and best practices are designed to complement the best practices in the [Reliability Pillar whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/welcome.html).

# Performance efficiency pillar

The performance efficiency pillar includes the ability to efficiently adhere to policy and mandate requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand or policy changes and technologies evolve.

The following questions and best practices are designed to complement the best practices in the [Performance Efficiency Pillar whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/performance-efficiency-pillar/welcome.html).

# Cost optimization pillar

The cost optimization pillar includes the ability to run services which deliver policy intent and user outcome at the best value.

The following question and best practices are designed to complement the best practices in the [Cost Optimization Pillar whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/cost-optimization-pillar/welcome.html).

# Sustainability pillar

The sustainability pillar focuses on environmental impacts from government systems, services, and policies, especially energy consumption and efficiency. The government typically has the largest information and communications technology (ICT) expenditure in a jurisdiction, so environmentally sustainable practices in government is key to driving a national sustainability agenda.

The following questions and best practices are designed to complement the best practices in the [Sustainability Pillar whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/sustainability-pillar/sustainability-pillar.html).
