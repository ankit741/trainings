What is state in React?
In simple terms, state is simply an object that contains all your key-value pairs. State determines how your components render and behave.

State allows your components to be dynamic and interactive.

State is not to be confused with props. State is what is managed within the component, whereas props is what gets passed to the component.


How classes manage local state in React ?


Class components come from ES6 classes and are the default method for managing local state. They also allow side effects to occur through lifecycle methods.

To access and manage state in a class, you have to initialize this.state as an object within your constructor(), name your local state as a key, and set its initial value as the keyâ€™s value.

setState() is the default method for updating the state in a class, and this is what causes a component to re-render.

Furthermore, it is recommended to call setState() every time you want to modify state correctly pre hooks.
