What is functional programming?

it is a programming paradigm where functions are king.Functional programming aims to be declarative and treats applications as the result of pure functions which are composed with one another.
In functional programming, functions are the first-class-citizens. For example, they can be passed as a parameter for other functions, or we can store them in variables. avoiding  side effect,share state and mutable.

A programming paradigm is essentially a bunch of rules that you follow when writing code.

If you're coding in a language that follows the declarative paradigm, you write code that specifies what you want to do, without saying how.

The principles of Functional Programming :

Pure functions:
================

A pure function is a function which:

Given the same inputs, always returns the same output
Has no side-effects

No side effects :

A side effect is when a functuion relies on or modify something outside of its scope.

Immutability:
===============

Immutability is at the core of functional programming. Immutability is the idea that once a value is declared, it is unchangeable and thus makes behaviours within your programme far more predictable.

Higher order functions :
========================

Higher order functions are functions which do at least one of the following:

Takes one or more functions as arguments
Returns a function as its result

All other functions are called first order functions.

Strict control flow (mapping input and output) :
================================================

Object-oriented programming focuses on classes and objects, rather than functions and logic
Object-orientation has multiple forms. For example, class-based inheritance (like Java or C#) or prototypal inheritance (like JavaScript). On top of that, objects embrace many core concepts. For us, the important one is encapsulation.

Encapsulation states that an object contains data and the operations, which work on the data. Moreover, in pure object-oriented languages, operations (functions) canâ€™t exist outside of objects.
