    <!-- Modern browsers are set up such that once they encounter a 
        JavaScript code they will essentially pause the rendering of HTML and run though 
        the entire JavaScript before they resume the HTML rendering. 
    
     Javascript is interpreted so it goes line by line so the document.write is running first
     and alert is running after it.Moreover, in single threaded javascript model the further 
     execution is stopped till the response of popups are received.-->
