/*

Syntax parser: program that reads your program to dertermine if its valid. it is part of interpreter.
goes through the code line by line.

Whitespace: Spaces and tab ex-  let name = 'ankt' , let name =           'ankt'
let name =           
'ankt';

JS doesn't care about whitespaces. the interpreter automatically reformats the whitespaces.

Semicolons: JS program made of many statements. ; are not mandatory in JS

Comments: remind you what u were trying to do. also, to other people what your code is meant to be doing.
          the more complex is your code the more comment you should make.
