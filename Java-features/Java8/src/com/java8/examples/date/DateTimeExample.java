/**
 * For practical reasons in computer systems we store time in discrete integer, mainly because
 * computer clocks tick discretely. Therefore we can store time as an integer value. By convention
 * we assign time = 0 to January 1st, 1970 but in Java we increment this value every millisecond,
 * not second like in UNIX time. Historically using 32-bit signed integer in UNIX time will cause
 * year 2038 problem. Thus Java stores time in 64-bit integer, which is sufficient even if you
 * increment it thousand times more often. That being said the simplest, yet valid way of storing
 * time in Java is... long primitive:
 * <p>
 * long timestamp = System.currentTimeMillis(); The problem with long is that it's so prevalent that
 * using it for storing time undermines the type system. It may be an ID, may be hash value, can be
 * anything. Also long doesn't have any meaningful methods related to time domain. The very first
 * approach to wrap long in more meaningful object was java.util.Date known since Java 1.0:
 * <p>
 * Date now = new Date(); Date class however has numerous flaws:
 * <p>
 * It does not represent... date. Seriously, officially date is "[...] the day of the month or year
 * as specified by a number [...]" [1] whereas in Java it represents point in time without any
 * specific calendar (day/month/year). Its toString() is misleading, displaying calendar date and
 * time in system timezone. Not only it misled thousands of developers to think that Date has a
 * timezone attached. Moreover it shows time, but date should only represent day, not hour. It has
 * 20+ deprecated methods, including getYear(), parse(String) and many constructors. These methods
 * are deprecated for a reason, because they lead you to believe Date represents, you know, date.
 * java.sql.Date extends java.util.Date and is actually much more accurate because it indeed
 * represents calendar date (DATE in SQL). However this narrows the functionality of base class
 * Date, thus violating Liskov substitution principle. Don't believe me? java.util.Date.toInstant()
 * works as expected but java.sql.Date.toInstant() fails unconditionally with
 * UnsupportedOperationException... Worst of them all, Date is mutable. Ever wondered why old and
 * grumpy developers in your team are so excited about immutability? Imagine a piece of code that
 * adds one minute to any Date. Simple, huh?
 * <p>
 * Date addOneMinute(Date in) { in.setTime(in.getTime() + 1_000 * 60); return in; } Looks fine,
 * right? All test cases pass because who on earth would ever validate that input parameters are
 * intact after testing code?
 * <p>
 * Date now = new Date(); System.out.println(now); System.out.println(addOneMinute(now));
 * System.out.println(now); The output may look as follows:
 * <p>
 * Tue Jul 26 22:59:22 CEST 2016 Tue Jul 26 23:00:22 CEST 2016 Tue Jul 26 23:00:22 CEST 2016 Did you
 * notice that now value was actually changed after adding one minute? When you have a function that
 * takes Date and returns Date you would never expect it to modify its parameters! It's like having
 * a function taking x and y numbers and retuning sum of them. If you discover that x was somehow
 * modified during the course of addition, all your assumptions are ruined. By the way that is the
 * reason why java.lang.Integer is immutable. Or String. Or BigDecimal.
