1. What is Programming Language?

Programming languages enable humans to interact with machines and make them perform necessary operations.
A programming language is a set of instructions and syntax used to create software programs.

Programming languages are broadly categorized into three types −

Machine level language   (low level)
=====================================
Low-level language is machine-dependent (0s and 1s) programming language. The processor runs low- level programs directly without the need of a compiler or interpreter, so the programs written in low-level language can be run very fast.

Assembly level language  (low level)
======================================
Assembly language (ASM) is also a type of low-level programming language that is designed for specific processors. It represents the set of instructions in a symbolic and human-understandable form. It uses an assembler to convert the assembly language to machine language.

The advantage of assembly language is that it requires less memory and less execution time to execute a program

High-level language
======================
High-level programming language (HLL) is designed for developing user-friendly software programs and websites. This programming language requires a compiler or interpreter to translate the program into machine language (execute the program).

The main advantage of a high-level language is that it is easy to read, write, and maintain.

High-level programming language includes Python, Java, JavaScript etc.


2. What is a Programming Paradigm?

Programming paradigms are different ways or styles in which a given program or programming language can be organized.By style, it doesn’t mean the choice of a specific language, but rather it refers to the way you program. There are several programming languages that programmers around the world use but all these programmers follow some specific strategy to implement the programs. This strategy that programmers follow is called a programming paradigm.

There are 2 basic types of programming paradigms followed by the programmers while writing their programs. These are as follows:

Imperative Programming Paradigm
Declarative Programming Paradigm

Imperative Programming
======================
Imperare is a Latin word that means command. Imperative programming consists of sets of detailed instructions that are given to the computer to execute in a given order. It's called "imperative" because as programmers we dictate exactly what the computer has to do, in a very specific way.

Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates, step by step.

The different imperative programming languages are further divided into three sub-styles:

Procedural Programming Paradigm
Object-Oriented Programming Paradigm
Parallel Processing Paradigm

Declarative Programming
========================
Declarative programming is all about hiding away complexity and bringing programming languages closer to human language and thinking. It's the direct opposite of imperative programming in the sense that the programmer doesn't give instructions about how the computer should execute the task, but rather on what result is needed.

Functional programming is one of the sub-style paradigm.


Declarative vs. Imperative Programming
=======================================

Imperative programming languages differ from declarative languages on one fundamental point: imperative programming focuses on the “how”, declarative programming on the “what”.

But what does that mean? Imperative programming languages are composed of step-by-step instructions (how) for the computer. They describe explicitly which steps are to be performed in what order to obtain the desired solution at the end. By contrast, in declarative programming, the desired result (what) is described directly. This becomes clearer when using a cooking analogy for illustration: imperative languages provide recipes; declarative languages contribute photos of the finished meal.

In declarative languages, the source code remains very abstract in terms of the specific procedure. To get to the solution, an algorithm is used which automatically identifies and applies appropriate methods. This approach has numerous advantages: Programs can be written much more quickly, and applications are also very easy to optimize. If a new method is developed in the future, the abstract instructions in the source code mean that the algorithm can easily utilize the newer method
